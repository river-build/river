### Messaging Data Structures

The core application supported by River Protocol is messaging. River Stream Nodes are tasked with serving stream events, which are represented as data using protobufs. Stream events themselves may contain message-like events or metadata to support event validation.

### Protocol Messaging Protobuf

The data schema of the River protocol can be defined declaratively by [protobuf.proto](https://github.com/river-build/river/blob/main/protocol/protocol.proto). Below is an elided snapshot of `protocol.proto` as of January 2024 containing only schema definitions used in a messaging context within the River protocol.

```proto
syntax = "proto3";
package river;
option go_package = "github.com/river-build/river/protocol";

import "google/protobuf/timestamp.proto";

/**
* StreamEvent is a single event in the stream.
*/
message StreamEvent {
    /**
     * Address of the creator of the event.
     * For user - address of the user's primary wallet.
     * For server - address of the server's keypair in staking smart contract.
     *
     * For the event to be valid:
     * If delegate_sig is present, creator_address must match delegate_sig.
     * If delegate_sig is not present, creator_address must match event signature in the Envelope.
     */
    bytes creator_address = 1;

     /**
      * delegate_sig allows event to be signed by device keypair
      * which is linked to the user's primary wallet.
      *
      * delegate_sig constains signature of the public key of the device keypair.
      * User's primary wallet is used to produce this signature.
      *
      * If present, for the event to be valid:
      * 1. creator_address must match delegate_sig's signer public key
      * 2. delegate_sig should be the signature of Envelope.signature's public key.
      *
      * Server nodes sign node-produced events with their own keypair and do not
      * need to use delegate_sig.

#### SpacePayload

`StreamEvent` messages encapsulate all message types handled by River Nodes. The primary unit of account for messaging is described in `SpacePayload`. A newly minted Space is represented on-chain with the SpaceFactory contract as well of in River Nodes and the River Chain, which stores the `streamId` of the Space.

There exists a 1-to-many relation between Spaces as defined in data by the `SpacePayload` message and `Channels`. Furthermore, `Memberships`, `usernames`, and `display_names` are stored and snapshotted within the `streamId` of a Space.

`SpacePayload` is made polymorphic using `oneof` in the above definition. River Nodes apply rules to each message after unpacking the `payload` field from the `StreamEvent`, which is the message transmitted to the River Node over the wire. These rules validate the legality of the `event` for writes that `addEvent` to the stream.

### Channel messages

Channel messages are the primary messages used to facilitate group chat within Spaces. They are defined in `ChannelPayload` in `protocol.proto`. Each `ChannelPayload` message is typed as `EncryptedData`, which is a message that defines the payload of ciphertext.

> Remember, River nodes never see plain text of messages. The protocol defines any message-like event or event that requires encryption with an `EncryptedData` or `WrappedEncryptedData` message type in `protocol.proto`.

### DM Channel messages

Direct messages are the second messaging primitive supported by the River protocol. The data structure representing direct messaging is defined by the `DmChannelPayload` protobuf. Each DM is created with the pair of users privy to the DM conversation. Note that just like with channel messages, DM's are `EncryptedData` messages from the node's vantage point.

### GDM Channel messages

Group direct message messages are supported by the River protocol as their own streams as well. Each Group DM is created with the list of members that forms the initial Membership roster. Though outside the specification of the protocol, the membership roster is meant to convey entitlement to encryption keys, such that clients can implement logic to share keys only with members of the same group dm.

> DM's, and GDM's are all created as new streams in the RiverNode using the `createStream` rpc client method. Unlike Spaces and Channels though, there exists no on-chain record of these streams.

### Media messages

Media files are supported as separate streams in River protocol associated with a parent `channel_id`. Messages added to a River node containing media must pass validation criteria that proves the `creator` is a member of that `channel_id` to prevent man-in-the-middle type attacks.

Media files can be quite large in size and as such are chunked in byte arrays on nodes and therefore support pagination by clients.
