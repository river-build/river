title: Local River Stream Node
description: River Stream Nodes can run remotely or locally depending on the operator's preferences. The following guide illustrates how to build and run a River Stream Node locally for development purposes. Diagnostic tools to gauge the health of local and remote nodes are also discussed here. It is assumed that the node is free standing and therefore not connected to the River protocol remote node registry on Base.

## Running a River Stream Node in Development

Running a River Stream Node from source is easy to do with [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), and [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) Ethereum toolkit installed. The following tutorial will show you how to run a River Stream Node with a Postgres backend.

### Requirements

- Docker
- Yarn 1.22
- Go 1.22.2 (see `go.work` file for up-to-date version)
- [protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/)
- [Buf](https://connect.build/docs/go/getting-started/#install-tools) tools (see [README.md](https://github.com/river-build/river/blob/main/core/node/README.md) for installation)
- Anvil - `curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash`

### Setup

Once you've installed Docker, Go, protobuf, Anvil, and buf, you can proceed to setup your environment as follows.

```bash
# clone monorepo
git clone https://github.com/river-build/river.git
```

### Run a River Stream Node Locally from Source using VSCode

There's a VSCode task in [tasks.json](https://github.com/river-build/river/blob/main/.vscode/tasks.json#L21) that is recommended to be used to multiple local stream nodes with attached postgres and local base, river chains, respectively running in different anvil ports.

Running `~Start Local Dev~` command from the river repo in VSCode will do the following in order:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check dependency versions"></Step>
<Step title="Upgrade Foundry toolkit"></Step>
<Step title="Run yarn install"></Step>
<Step title="Build protobufs"></Step>
<Step title="Start Base Chain in anvil"></Step>
<Step title="Start River Chain in anvil"></Step>
<Step title="Configure stream nodes"></Step>
<Step title="Start stream nodes with and without entitlements (on separate ports)"></Step>
<Step title="Start xchain binary"></Step>
<Step title="Start protobuf and typescript package watcher"></Step>
</Steps>

After the command completes, pick a `river_node` process running from localhost and run `/status` check to see if the node is running in a healthy manner. The following should be returned if the node is healthy:

```

}
{
  "result": "OK",
  "chain_id": 31337,
  "block": 457,
  "latency": "450.875µs"
}
```

You can also ping health of nodes using `/debug/multi` and `/debug/multi/json` endpoints which return html and json respectively. These endpoints return latency connecting to node on loopback address as well as grpc, http and rpc provider health.

```bash
➜  docs git:(jt/update-local-node-setup) ✗ curl https://localhost:5157/debug/multi/json | jq '.[]'

### Run a River Stream Node in Info Mode against testnet or mainnet

<Note>To run a stream node within the remote testnet or mainnet networks, the node needs to be first registered on River Chain. See onboarding instructions [here](/run/node-operator/system-requirements-installation).</Note>


### Running a stream node in info mode to obtain diagnostics

If you'd like to run an unattached stream node in info mode to inspect the remote status of nodes in either testnet or mainnet, you can do so by running the following:

```bash
# from the river repo root
cd core/node
# run a node in info mode to proxy http, grpc connection health from either testnet or mainnet.
# testnet
./env/gamma/run.sh info
# mainnet
./env/omega/run.sh info
# navigate to the node url in your browser to see the status of the corresponding network's nodes
# open http://localhost:4040/debug/multi in a browser or curl the url to return html


# ping testnet or mainnet nodes
./env/gamma/run.sh ping
./env/omega/run.sh ping
```
