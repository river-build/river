title: Introduction
description: "The Towns Protocol is powered by a network of Stream Nodes that are registered on chain and run by Node Operators. This guide is intended as an introduction to getting started as an operator and running a node in the Towns network."

### Operating Towns Components

[Towns Stream Nodes](https://github.com/river-build/river/tree/main/core/node) are software components that are able to be run by anyone. Towns Protocol's incentive structure supports Towns Stream Node operators as a first-class actor in the network. Operators, once registered and approved by the DAO , can run a Stream Node on Towns Chain and participate in block validation as well as reward distribution.

Given the open-source nature of River, the Foundation also encourages developers who would like to run instances of Towns Chain on a network of their choice connected to self-hosted Towns Stream Nodes. Though these nodes would not technically be connected to the Towns protocol node network that is deployed on [Base Mainnet](https://basescan.org/), developers may find value in experimenting with different rollup implementation features.

### Operator Onboarding Lifecycle

Operator and node onboarding to the network follow a multi-stage lifecycle that is designed to ensure the operator is fully prepared and meets [requirements](/run/node-operator/system-requirements-installation) to run a node in mainnet. 

Each of the following steps are described in detail in subsequent sections.

#### Stream Node Configuration Modes

The below table outlines the current operator service level that is supported by the Towns Protocol. Supported configurations are outlined in subsequent sections.

| Configuration   | Description                                                                                      | Node Registration     | Stream Reads         | Stream Writes        | Support             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Full node       | Stream node running inside Towns node network                                                   | required | yes                  | yes                  | supported         |
| Info mode       | Stream node running in info mode, unattached to the network, for debug purposes only.            | no                    | no      | no     | supported         |
| Archival node   | Stream node running outside Towns node network storing all stream events from Towns node network | no                    | proxied | proxied | not yet supported |
