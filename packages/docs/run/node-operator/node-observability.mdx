title: Node Observability
description: The following guide describes the observability capabilities of River Stream Nodes and how to monitor and manage them.

Stream nodes expose `/metrics` to export Prometheus metrics on port `443`. The metrics are exposed in the Prometheus format and can be scraped by a Prometheus server. Both `process_` and `river_` prefixed metrics are exportable.

Below are the required environment variables for the **River Stream Node Container** related to telemetry:

| Environment Variable | Value |Secret|
|---------------------------|---------|----------|
|METRICS__ENABLED|true|no|
|LOG__FORMAT|json|no|
|LOG__LEVEL|info|no|
|LOG__NOCOLOR|true|no|
