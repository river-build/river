title: Contracts
description: Smart Contracts powering the Towns Protocol are deployed to Ethereum L2 networks for testnet and mainnet. This page provides a list of deployed contracts needed for running nodes and their network coordinates.
---


<Note>
All contract source and deployed addresses can also be found on the [Towns Protocol repo in github](https://github.com/river-build/river).
Contract source code is located in the `contracts` [directory](https://github.com/river-build/river/tree/main/contracts).
Deployed addresses can be found under `packages/generated` for testnet and mainnet, respectively.
</Note>

### Network Chain Ids

| Network | Chain Id | Network Environment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Base Sepolia | 84532 | Testnet |
| Towns Chain Testnet | 6524490 | Testnet |
| Base | 8453 | Mainnet |

### Contract Addresses

Below are contract addresses to diamond contracts that are required to register a node operator on Base.

<Note>All contracts are deployed using the [Diamond](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) pattern for modularity. Contract source can be found in the [river](https://github.com/river-build/river/tree/main/contracts/src) repo.</Note>
