### Proposal Eligibility

Eligible participants in the governance process include:

1. **Space Owner NFT Holders**: Those with more than 100 fee contributing members
2. **Node Operator NFT Holders**: Must be visibly active for over 30 days.

### Proposal Initiation

- **Group 1**: Any holder of a Space Owner NFT of a Space with at least 200 members.
- **Group 2**: Any holder with a Node Operator NFT marked ‘active’ for at least 30 days.

Members from either group can submit proposals for consideration.

### Voting Phase

Both groups (Space Owner and Node Operator NFT Holders) are entitled to participate in the voting process for proposals.

## Special Provisions

- **Subgroup Decisions**: Smaller decisions can be delegated to subgroups, which are assigned specific permissions and may receive allocated funds from the primary treasury for their operations.
- **On-chain Upgrades**: The DAO has the authority to upgrade any component that exists on-chain. This includes altering Node Registry contract requirements, adjusting fees received from Membership Token minting, and the ability to upgrade or pause the Space Factory and associated contracts.

## River Token and DAO Governance

The River token serves as the governance token within the River ecosystem. It is instrumental for:

1. Incentivizing node operators and users.
2. Facilitating long-term growth and governance.
3. Allocating received fees and treasury funds.

## Contract Upgrades and Verification

- **Upgrade Flexibility**: River contracts can be upgraded for added functionality or security, but Spaces retain the choice to opt out of future upgrades, maintaining the status quo if preferred.
- **Verification and Development**: All contracts are verified on [BaseScan](https://basescan.org/) and are built using [Forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std) and [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) tools. Space Owner NFTs and Node Operator NFTs empower holders to engage actively in River DAO Governance.
