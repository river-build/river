## Rebalancing in Distributed Systems

In distributed systems, rebalancing is a critical process required to prevent specific nodes from being overloaded. This need arises particularly when nodes join or leave the network. It's crucial to differentiate between a node crash exiting and a node cleanly exiting, as these scenarios necessitate distinct responses.

When a node exits a distributed system, it is essential to have a signal and corresponding logic to determine how to rebalance the network. The rebalance logic can be incorporated into a smart contract. However, generating a signal in a decentralized system is more challenging. Currently, there's ongoing research exploring methods for the protocol to autonomously detect crash exits through communication with other nodes. This approach aims to create a fully decentralized solution.

In the interim, a hybrid process is being utilized. This process involves 'watchers' that are part of the River DAO. These watchers are responsible for monitoring the system and providing signals to initiate rebalancing when a node crashes or exits unexpectedly. This hybrid approach serves as a transitional solution while more autonomous and decentralized methods are being developed and refined.
