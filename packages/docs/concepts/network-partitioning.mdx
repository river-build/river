title: Network Partitioning
description: ""
---

In the event of complete network partitioning, where the majority of nodes reside in a single partition, the stream will continue to grow and blocks will be produced. Nodes in the minority partition will stall. As a potential future upgrade, a feature could be developed to avoid stalling nodes.
In the case of partial partitioning, where some stream nodes do not see other nodes in the group serving the same stream, but a connected path among all nodes still exists, the stream will continue to progress as normal due to active minipool reconciliation. That is, nodes will actively fetch events when they observe a NodeToNode.NewEventInPool operation with an unknown hash.
