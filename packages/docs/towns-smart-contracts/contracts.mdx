## Current Deployment of Towns Protocol Smart Contracts

### Overview

This section provides an overview of the current deployment of key Towns smart contracts.

### Key Smart Contracts

Towns smart contracts are deployed using the Diamond Pattern (see [EIP-2525](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535)), which improves upon modularity and upgradeability.

The following is the current list of deployed diamond contracts on Base and a link to their associated facet addresses.

| Diamond      | Network | Address                                    | Facet Addresses |
| ------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| SpaceFactory | Base    | 0x9978c826d93883701522d2CA645d5436e5654252 | [Louper Link](https://louper.dev/diamond/0x9978c826d93883701522d2CA645d5436e5654252?network=base) |

### Accessing and Interacting with the Contracts

These addresses provide direct access to the deployed contracts on Base. Developers and users of the Towns ecosystem can interact with these contracts for various purposes, including creating new Spaces, managing memberships, and implementing pricing strategies.
