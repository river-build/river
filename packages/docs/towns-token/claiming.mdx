title: Claiming Rewards 
---


## Claim Process 

At the end of each distribution period, addresses that are delegating or designated as [Authorized Claimers](./delegation) can claim their rewards.

## Claim Execution

Rewards are claimed by calling the `claim()` function on the Distribution contract, which transfers the tokens to the claimant's wallet. 

If the wallet is already delegating on Base, the newly acquired tokens are automatically delegated to the same operator, conforming to the [ERC20Votes](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#ERC20Votes) specification.
