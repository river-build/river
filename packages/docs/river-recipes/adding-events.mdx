title: Adding Events to River Stream
description: ""
---

### Adding events to a River Stream

Events can be added to a River Stream Node over rpc using the service interface exposed by the protocol in `protocol.proto`. The following guide will illustrate a concrete example of making an `addEvent` request.

### Requirements

- protobuf@3
- bufbuild/buf/buf

### Dependencies

To run the below recipe, you'll want to create a Typescript project with a `package.json` file with the below dependencies. The river dependencies require building `harmony-web` (see `README.md`)

- ethers
- @river/waterproof
- @river/sdk


<Note>The following recipe assumes a client rpc service generated from protocol.proto and that the user's wallet is a valid wallet for adding an event to its own `UserStream`.</Note>


#### Adding an event to UserStream

Users that have initialized their UserStream can add events to those streams. Adding other `message` events to a different stream follows from this guide given all events are added using the `addEvent` RPC method implemented by the node's `StreamService`.

Create a typescript file and follow the below steps to add an event. You will need to set `RIVER_STREAM_SERVER_URL` as well, which you can set to the test node at `https://node1-test.towns.com`.
  
<Note>ES Module syntax is assumed in below example code.</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Import package dependencies">
    ```typescript
    import { ethers } from 'ethers'
    import { makeOldTownsDelegateSig, bin_fromHexString } from '@river/waterproof'
    import {
        ParsedStreamResponse,
        SignerContext,
        StreamRpcClient,
        makeEvent,
        makeStreamRpcClient,
        makeUserStreamId,
        unpackStream,
        userIdFromAddress,
        make_UserPayload_Inception,
    } from '@river/sdk'

    console.log('adding-events.ts')
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new random delegate wallet and signer context">
    ```javascript
    async function createSignerContext(): Promise<SignerContext> {
        // primary wallet can be a random new wallet
        // if we are just registering a new wallet
        // and not performing any on-chain transactions.
        const primaryWallet = ethers.Wallet.createRandom()
        const delegateWallet = ethers.Wallet.createRandom()
        const creatorAddress = bin_fromHexString(await primaryWallet.getAddress())
        const delegateSig = await makeOldTownsDelegateSig(primaryWallet, delegateWallet.publicKey)
        const pk = delegateWallet.privateKey.slice(2)
        const context: SignerContext = {
            signerPrivateKey: () => pk,
            creatorAddress,
            delegateSig,
        }
        return context
}
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create client instance of river StreamService">
  ```javascript
  function createRpcClient(serverUrl: string): StreamRpcClient {
    const rpcClient = makeStreamRpcClient(serverUrl)
    return rpcClient
}
```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize UserStream with wallet">
    ```javascript
    async function initializeUserStream(rpcClient: StreamRpcClient, context: SignerContext) {
        try {
            const userId = userIdFromAddress(context.creatorAddress)
            const userStreamId = makeUserStreamId(userId)

            const createUserStream = async (userStreamId: string): Promise<ParsedStreamResponse> => {
                const userEvents = [
                    await makeEvent(
                        context,
                        make_UserPayload_Inception({
                            streamId: userStreamId,
                        }),
                    ),
                ]
                const response = await rpcClient.createStream({
                    events: userEvents,
                    streamId: userStreamId,
                })
                return unpackStream(response.stream)
            }
            const userStream = await createUserStream(userStreamId)
            console.log(`created user stream ${userStreamId}`)
        } catch (e) {
            console.log('error creating user stream')
            throw e
        }
}
    ```
    In the above function, `createUserStream` adds an inception event to the user stream associated with the user's streamId, which is derived from the user's userId.
    <Note>All streams are created with inception event that marks the genesis of the stream.</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Helper script to run all above functions to addEvent to new UserStream">
  ```javascript
    async function main() {
    const context = await createSignerContext()
    const rpcClient = createRpcClient(RIVER_STREAM_SERVER_URL)
    await initializeUserStream(rpcClient, context)
}

main()
```
  </Step>
</Steps>
