### What is the minimal, sufficient criteria needed for nodes to enter the Towns network ? 

Upon registering as a Node Operator and receiving sufficient delegation of RVR tokens by the DAO, nodes under the Node Operator will enter the active set and be eligible to host / server streams. 

Mechanically, to enter the active set, the DAO will bridge a new Node Operator to the Towns Chain network after which the operator can register a new node with the TownsRegistry contract.

### What are the conditions upon which a node can be removed from the active set ?

Node can be removed from the active set at the DAO's discretion if they do not maintain minimal criteria for uptime, storage, and network performance. 

### Are there token minimums for Node Operators to enter the network ?

Yes, the DAO will require a minimum of 100mm RVR tokens and maximum of 500mm RVR tokens to be delegated to a Node Operator before they can enter the Towns Network. 

### How often are rewards distributed to Node Operators and Delegators ?

Rewards are distributed every two weeks to Node Operators and Delegators. 

### How are rewards split between Node Operators and Delegators ?

Rewards are paid to Node Operators based on their commission rate set during registration and remaining proceeds are split pro-rata amongst all the delegators who delegated to that operator for the entire period.
