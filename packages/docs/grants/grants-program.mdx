## **Overview**

The **Towns Protocol Grants Program** is designed to accelerate the growth of decentralized social by funding builders who contribute meaningfully to the protocol. Our goal is to:

* Drive innovation through new products and features

* Onboard new projects that enhance the Towns ecosystem

* Improve protocol infrastructure with better tooling, automation, and scalability

Each year is divided into **two Seasons**, with **grants awarded on a rolling basis** throughout each season. This structure allows us to **adjust priorities every six months**, ensuring that grant allocations align with the protocol’s most pressing needs.

## Season One Details

Grant Funding: **Up to $250,000** 

Season 1 Deadline: **April 30, 2025**

[**Apply Here**](https://hntlabs.deform.cc/grants)

## **Types of Grants**

Towns Protocol Grants are categorized into two primary funding tracks:

### **1. Ecosystem Grants**&#x20;

These grants fund specific technical projects that expand the **capabilities of Towns Protocol**. We are looking for teams to:

* **Build New Clients**

  → Develop custom interfaces and applications on top of Towns Protocol, just like propeller.chat, which launched its own independent Towns-based client.

### **2. Registry Grants**

For developers building **bots, entitlement modules, and pricing models** needed for Towns Protocol:

* **Develop Bots**

  → Automate governance, moderation, engagement, and integrations across the Towns ecosystem.

* **Create Custom Modules**

  → Design new entitlement (access control) and pricing models that enable novel economic structures and community governance.

## **Grant Funding & Distribution**

In Season 1, we will distribute grants up to $250k allocated in Towns tokens to fund grants across four categories:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Building New Clients" defaultOpen={false}>
    We're looking for teams to build independent clients on Towns Protocol-mobile apps, web interfaces, or something entirely new. You can build any type of product that has a forum or messaging component: Think web3 versions of Substack, Patreon, Telegram, Reddit, etc.

    * Check out Propeller.chat, a product feedback client built on Towns Protocol. If you want to launch your own product on top of Towns Protocol, we'll fund you.

    * We have an SDK to make things easier as you get started. You can find our React SDK in our docs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Building Bots " defaultOpen={false}>
    Bots make communities smarter. Build tools that automate **moderation, governance, notifications, or integrations** with DeFi, trading, or other apps. If it makes Towns Protocol more functional, we want to support it.

    Here are some ideas:

    * ﻿﻿Cross-Platform Social bots (post to Towns and also Lens/Farcaster)

    * ﻿﻿Wallet following bots

    * ﻿﻿DAO voting bots

    * ﻿﻿Music/Translation/Gaming/Meme bots
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Building Entitlement Modules" defaultOpen={false}>
    Access control matters. We’re funding **token-gated systems, staking-based roles, NFT memberships, and other permission models** to give communities more control over who can do what.

    Here are some ideas:

    * ﻿﻿Token-Staking Access (If you stake a token for a certain length of time, you can access a specific Town)

    * ﻿﻿Submit a bid for a membership to a Town

    * ﻿﻿NFT-Based Permissions (Different NFT traits grant unique abilities, like voting power, moderation rights, or premium content access)

    * ﻿﻿Proof of Participation Roles: Users must complete tasks (e.g., voting, attending events, posting in discussions) to unlock new permissions.

    * ﻿﻿POAP-Based Entry: Users must have attended specific events (verified via POAPs) to gain access.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Building Pricing Modules" defaultOpen={false}>
    Monetization is key. Build **paywalls, tipping systems, subscriptions, or custom pricing models** that let communities experiment with value exchange on Towns Protocol.

    Here are some ideas:

    * ﻿﻿Recurring weekly/monthly/yearly payments to access Towns

    * ﻿﻿Time-Release Models (This Town can be joined for a certain period of time)

    * ﻿﻿Auctions to create bidding for premium access to Towns

    * ﻿﻿Leaderboard-driven contributions (Top supporters of a Town get recognition and special perks)

| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Initial Review on Relevance** | We assess the project's alignment with **Towns Protocol’s mission**, its potential impact on decentralized social, and its contribution to the ecosystem.                 |
| **Technical Assessment**        | We evaluate the project's technical feasibility, scalability, potential challenges, and how it integrates with **Towns Protocol** and broader Web3 infrastructure.        |
| **Decision on Progression**     | Reviewers determine whether the project meets our criteria for innovation, feasibility, and value to **Towns Protocol**. Successful projects move on to the second round. |

### Second Round

|                              |                                                                                                                                               |

| **Milestone & Grant Amount** | We finalize key milestones and confirm the grant amount with each team, ensuring alignment on deliverables and funding structure.             |
| **Q\&A Calls**               | Grant reviewers and project teams engage in **Q\&A sessions** to clarify objectives, expectations, and next steps before funding is released. |
