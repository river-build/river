## **Overview**

The **Towns Protocol Grants Program** is designed to accelerate the growth of decentralized social by funding builders who contribute meaningfully to the protocol. Our goal is to:

* Drive **innovation** through new products and features

* Onboard **new projects** that enhance the Towns ecosystem

* Improve **protocol infrastructure** with better tooling, automation, and scalability

Each year is divided into **two Seasons**, with **grants awarded on a rolling basis** throughout each season. This structure allows us to **adjust priorities every six months**, ensuring that grant allocations align with the protocol’s most pressing needs.

## Season One Details

Grant Funding: **Up to $250,000** 

Season 1 Deadline: **April 30, 2025**

[**Apply Here**](https://form.typeform.com/to/bGX4kWyn)****&#x20;

## **Types of Grants**

Towns Protocol Grants are categorized into two primary funding tracks:

### **1. Ecosystem Grants**&#x20;

These grants fund specific technical projects that expand the **capabilities of Towns Protocol**. We are looking for teams to:

* **Build New Clients** → Develop custom interfaces and applications on top of Towns Protocol, just like [**Propeller**](https://propeller.chat/), which launched its own independent Towns-based client.

### **2. Registry Grants**

For developers building **bots, entitlement modules, and pricing models** needed for Towns Protocol:

* **Develop Bots** → Automate governance, moderation, engagement, and integrations across the Towns ecosystem.

* **Create Custom Modules** → Design new [**entitlement**](https://docs.towns.com/towns-smart-contracts/roles-entitlements) (access control) and [**pricing**](https://docs.towns.com/towns-smart-contracts/pricing-modules) models that enable novel economic structures and community governance.

## **Grant Funding & Distribution**

In Season 1, we will distribute grants up to $250k (allocated in $Towns) to fund grants across four categories:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Building New Clients" defaultOpen={false}>
    We’re looking for teams to build **independent clients** on Towns Protocol—mobile apps, web interfaces, or something entirely new. Think **Propeller**, which built its own Towns-based client. If you want to launch your own product on top of Towns Protocol, we’ll fund you.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Building Bots " defaultOpen={false}>
    Bots make communities smarter. Build tools that automate **moderation, governance, notifications, or integrations** with DeFi, trading, or other apps. If it makes Towns Protocol more functional, we want to support it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Building Entitlement Modules" defaultOpen={false}>
    Access control matters. We’re funding **token-gated systems, staking-based roles, NFT memberships, and other permission models** to give communities more control over who can do what.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Building Pricing Modules" defaultOpen={false}>
    Monetization is key. Build **paywalls, tipping systems, subscriptions, or custom pricing models** that let communities experiment with value exchange on Towns Protocol.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Initial Review on Relevance**             | We assess the project's alignment with **Towns Protocol’s mission**, its potential impact on decentralized social, and its contribution to the ecosystem.                 |
| **Technical Assessment**                    | We evaluate the project's technical feasibility, scalability, potential challenges, and how it integrates with **Towns Protocol** and broader Web3 infrastructure.        |
| **Decision on Progression**                 | Reviewers determine whether the project meets our criteria for innovation, feasibility, and value to **Towns Protocol**. Successful projects move on to the second round. |
| **Second Round**                            |                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Plan Presentation**                       | Selected teams present a detailed project plan, incorporating feedback from the first round.                                                                              |
| **Milestone and Grant Amount Confirmation** | We finalize key milestones and confirm the grant amount with each team, ensuring alignment on deliverables and funding structure.                                         |
| **Q\&A Calls**                              | Grant reviewers and project teams engage in **Q\&A sessions** to clarify objectives, expectations, and next steps before funding is released.                             |
