## Overview and Functionality

The Node Registry primary function is to manage the lifecycle of nodes â€” from their onboarding to their operational monitoring. This includes a rigorous registration process, ensuring that each node adheres to the network's stringent standards for performance and reliability. In essence, the Node Registry acts as the gatekeeper, maintaining the network's integrity and efficiency.

### Registration and Verification

At the heart of the Node Registry is the registration and verification process. New nodes are onboarded through a procedure that evaluates their compliance with specific performance and security standards. This process is crucial, as it maintains the high caliber of the network's infrastructure, ensuring that each node is capable and trustworthy. Requirements are able to evolve over time and adapt to incentives created by the protocol and demand for more operators.

### Node Management and Performance Monitoring

Once integrated into the network, nodes are continuously monitored for their performance and activity. This ongoing surveillance serves multiple purposes: it ensures that nodes remain operational and efficient, and it also provides critical data for network health assessments. The Node Registry's role in node management is pivotal in upholding the network's robustness and responsiveness.

### Deployment

The Node Registry is deployed on Base so that it can easily interact with both cross-chain entitlement contracts and governance contracts that also live on Base. Required information is subsequently bridged back and forth between Base and Towns Chain.

## Integration and Role within the Towns Chain

The Node Registry is not an isolated entity; it is deeply integrated into the Towns Chain's fabric. Implemented as a smart contract, it leverages the blockchain's inherent characteristics of immutability and transparency. This integration is vital for several reasons:

- **Coordination with Stream Registry**: The Node Registry works closely with the Stream Registry, ensuring a harmonious and efficient allocation of nodes to various streams within the Towns Messaging Protocol.
- **Upholding Decentralization and Security**: By managing the nodes in a decentralized manner, the Node Registry reinforces the network's distributed architecture, which is fundamental for security and resilience.
