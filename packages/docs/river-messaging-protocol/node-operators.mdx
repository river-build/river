## Registration and Delegation

- **Node Registry Contract**: Node Operators begin by calling the `register` function on the Node Registry contract deployed on Base. This initial step enters them into the system and marks the beginning of their operational journey.
- **Soliciting Delegation**: After registration, Node Operators are eligible to solicit delegation to their address. This is a crucial step where operators gather support from token holders, who delegate their tokens to the operator as a sign of trust and endorsement.

## Approval Process

- **Petitioning the DAO**: Once a Node Operator has accumulated sufficient delegation, they can petition the DAO for approval. This step is vital as it involves a review by the DAO to ensure the operator meets the required standards and guidelines for network operation.

- **DAO Approval**: If the DAO approves the petition, the Node Operator is officially added to the active set on the River Registry contract deployed on the River Chain. This approval marks the operator as a trusted and recognized entity within the network.

## Node Management

- **Adding Individual Nodes**: With DAO approval, Node Operators can then add individual Nodes under their wing. This involves configuring and setting up Nodes to perform various functions within the network.

- **Node States**: Nodes can exist in several states:
  - **Idle**: Newly added Nodes start in an idle state, where they are present within the network but not actively participating in operations.
  - **Unattached State**: Nodes can then move to an unattached state, where they run and relay requests without being responsible for any specific stream. In this state, Nodes do not have dedicated storage and serve a more auxiliary function.
  - **Attached State**: The ultimate goal for a Node is to reach the attached state, where it becomes fully operational and responsible for new streams. In this state, a Node is fully integrated into the network, participating in data storage, processing, and relay functions.
  - **Exiting**: The Node is signaling that it is planning to exit and so should begin offloading stream data to other active nodes in the network.
