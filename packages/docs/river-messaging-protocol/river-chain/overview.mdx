# River Chain: Overview

## Introduction

River Chain is an Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain built on OP-Stack that serves as the foundation for consensus and data integrity of streams. This section outlines the key aspects of the River Chain, elaborating on its role, functionality, and significance within the River Messaging Protocol ecosystem.

## Core Functionality

### Layer 2 Blockchain

- **Roll-up to Ethereum**: River Chain operates as a Layer 2 solution, rolling up to the Ethereum blockchain, thereby leveraging its security and trustworthiness while offering enhanced scalability and efficiency.
- **OP-Stack**: The chain is built on OP-stack getting the benefits of a battle tested Ethereum L2 stack with a future path of interoperability

### Smart Contract Integration

- **Stream Registry Contract**: Manages the allocation and operation of Stream Nodes, central to the messaging process.
- **Node Registry Contract**: Facilitates the registration and management of nodes within the network, ensuring a reliable and distributed node infrastructure.

## Scalability and Efficiency

- **High Throughput**: Designed for handling a large volume of messaging data with minimal latency, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Resource Optimization**: By operating as a Layer 2 solution, River Chain maintains low transaction costs and efficient resource usage, crucial for sustainable operation.
