# WARNING

This script has been updated to remove all data migration logic after all public networks migrated to the current stream schema. However, it has not been carefully tested since this change and should be relied upon with caution.

### Build migration tool

Update `river_migrate_db.env` with correct parameters.

Source DB still can be in use at this point.

go build -o river_migrate_db .

./river_migrate_db help
./river_migrate_db source test # test source config
./river_migrate_db target test # test target config

Note: shutdown node process connected to source DB during migration process below.

### Run migration tool

    ./river_migrate_db target create  # create target schema (i.e. db partition)
    ./river_migrate_db target init  # create targe tables

    # shutdown container that is connected to source db

    ./river_migrate_db copy  # copy data from source to target

    # Inspect specific stream content
    ./river_migrate_db source inspect <streamId>
    ./river_migrate_db target inspect <streamId>

    # reconfigure node container to use target db & estart node

For command-line options use `help` command.
