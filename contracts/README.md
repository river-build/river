<b>To compile the smart contracts located in `./contracts`:</b>

```shell
forge build
```

Compiled contracts will be output to the `./out` folder

<b>To run the solidity unit tests:</b>

```shell
forge test
```

You can add verbosity to the tests by adding `-vvvv` (1-4 levels) to the command

<b>To start a local ethereum blockchain:</b>

```shell
anvil
```

It will generate a set of 10 public/private keys with 10k ether each. Save one of these private keys for deployment
below.\
It starts listening on `http://127.0.0.1:8545`\
If you want to interact with anvil via a front end, you will need to add the local network to Metamask
with `ChainID=1337`

<b>To start a local base blockchain and river blockchain run</b>

```shell
./scripts/bc-all-start.sh
```

<b>To deploy our contracts to your local base and river instances</b>

1. duplicate `.env.localhost` file in the [contracts](.) folder of the project and rename it to `.env` (this is excluded
   from git via .gitignore)
2. run `export RIVER_ENV="local_single"` from your terminal
3. you will then run `./scripts/deploy-contracts.sh` to deploy the entire suite of contracts to your local base-anvil
   and river-anvil chains.

<b>To deploy a single diamond base contract to your local anvil instance</b>\
from within the `contracts/` folder you can run `make deploy-base-anvil contract=Deploy[Contract]` you will replace
the `[Contract]` part with the contract you want to deploy, you can see all the contracts available for deployment
in [this](./scripts/deployments) part of the project.

<b>To deploy a facet base contract to your local anvil instance</b>\
from within the `contracts/` folder you can run `make deploy-base-anvil contract=Deploy[Facet] type=facet` you will
replace the `[Facet]` part with the contract you want to deploy, you can see all the facets available for deployment
in [this](./scripts/deployments/facets) part of the project.
