##
## "Code Owners" is an unfortunate name, as we do not encourage "ownership"
## of code per se.
##
## Please add your name here if you would like to be notified any time
## a change is made in a particular file or folder.
##
## We do this to help individuals keep their mental model of the codebase
## up to date, and to make sure everyone who wants to be part of the conversation
## is automagically added to the it.
##
## We do not do this to create dictators, benevolent or otherwise.
##
## IMPORTANT - If you add yourself as a code owner, please take it upon yourself
## to review code at minimum, at the beginning, and end, of each work day.
## Please either comment, approve, request changes, or remove yourself as a reviewer.
## The SLA on reviews is 24 hours. After 24 hours a PR without comments will be
## considered defacto approved and can be committed. However feedback can come
## at any time! We are an asynchronous team of imperfect humans. If anyone, code
## owner or otherwise, comments on your code at any time, please assume the best
## intentions and respond with care and consideration.
##
